# bootstrap-portfolio

Revamped portfolio site using bootstrap, for homework assignment 2.

I found it much easier to maintain consistent layout and styling after rebuilding nav bar, some body sections and footer using the bootstrap content.

Had slight difficulty "overriding" some of the bootstrap styles to add my own creativity but was able to use the browser console to troubleshoot, identify and ultimately overcome these isses (ie: used !important tag in my own styling to cancel a place where the bootstrap CDN also utilized it). 

My portfolio and contact pages are very similar to their originals because by the time I worked on those in December, we'd already begun learning bootstrap methodology.
